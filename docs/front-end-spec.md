- **Cart Updates:** Subtle bounce animation for cart additions (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Modal Open/Close:** Fade and scale animations (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Under 3 seconds for initial page load
- **Interaction Response:** Under 100ms for user interactions
- **Animation FPS:** 60fps for smooth animations

### Design Strategies

- **Progressive Loading:** Load critical content first, enhance progressively
- **Image Optimization:** WebP format with fallbacks, lazy loading
- **Component Lazy Loading:** Load non-critical components on demand
- **Caching Strategy:** Effective browser and CDN caching
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Reduce third-party script impact
