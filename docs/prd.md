*Generated on: [Current Date]*

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Eliminate 15-20% marketplace fees by building direct-to-customer ecommerce platform
- Achieve $100K+ annual sales within 12 months of launch
- Acquire 500+ new customers within the first year
- Increase profit margins by 10-15% compared to high-fee platforms
- Establish direct customer relationships without platform intermediaries
- Maintain 3%+ conversion rate from website visitors to customers
- Achieve 4.5+ star customer satisfaction rating
- Generate 10,000+ monthly visitors within 6 months
- Keep customer acquisition costs below $25 per customer
- Maintain 99.5%+ platform uptime for ecommerce operations
- Achieve 99%+ successful payment processing rate
- Keep cart abandonment below 70%

### Background Context
The ecommerce landscape is dominated by major marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, Etsy) that charge exorbitant fees of 15-20%, significantly cutting into seller profits. Small businesses and entrepreneurs are forced to choose between high marketplace fees or expensive custom ecommerce development, with limited control over customer relationships and data. This project addresses this market gap by building a single-seller ecommerce platform on Strapi's headless CMS architecture that eliminates marketplace fees while providing essential ecommerce functionality and minimal company profile pages (About and Contact). The solution prioritizes sales and product discovery while maintaining professional presentation and trust-building elements.
