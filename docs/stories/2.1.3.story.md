## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The inventory management system migration demonstrates excellent adherence to new coding and test standards. The migration from Entity Service API to Document Service API was executed successfully with proper TypeScript interfaces, comprehensive error handling, and maintainable code structure. All 50 tests are passing, demonstrating full functionality preservation while meeting new standards.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary as the implementation already meets the new standards requirements. The code demonstrates:
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all request/response types
- Document Service API migration with correct patterns
- Comprehensive error handling with typed error messages
- New import/export standards with grouped imports
- Jest 30+ test patterns with proper mocking

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ PASS - All new standards implemented correctly
- Project Structure: ✓ PASS - Proper file organization and naming conventions
- Testing Strategy: ✓ PASS - Jest 30+ with comprehensive test coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ PASS - All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Inventory controller migrated to Document Service API with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Inventory service migrated to Document Service API with proper typing
- [x] All tests updated to Jest 30+ standards with new patterns
