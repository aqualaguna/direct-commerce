- **Coverage requirements**: 85% minimum coverage for payment-related code due to critical security nature

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance]
- Payment processing must complete within 10 seconds
- Payment method validation must complete within 2 seconds
- Webhook processing must complete within 5 seconds
- Payment status updates must be real-time
- Implement payment result caching for performance

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security]
- All payment data must be PCI DSS compliant
- Implement end-to-end encryption for payment data
- Secure payment session management with timeouts
- Validate all payment inputs and prevent injection attacks
- Implement payment rate limiting and fraud detection

**PCI Compliance Requirements**
- No sensitive payment data stored in application database
- All payment data transmitted over TLS 1.3
- Implement secure payment tokenization
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Payment data retention and disposal policies

**Version Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Strapi 4.25+ for content management
- Node.js 20+ for modern JavaScript features
- TypeScript 5.9.2+ for type safety
- Jest 30+ for testing framework
- Stripe SDK 14+ for payment processing
- PayPal SDK 7+ for PayPal integration

### Integration Points
- **Checkout System**: Process payments from checkout sessions [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#checkout-endpoints]
- **Order Management**: Update order payment status after successful payment
- **User Management**: Store and manage user payment methods
- **Notification System**: Send payment confirmation and error notifications
- **Analytics**: Track payment success rates and conversion metrics
- **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for fraudulent payment attempts

### Project Structure Notes
- Payment data models follow established Strapi patterns
- Payment components integrate with existing checkout and order management
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions established in the project
- Test structure aligns with existing testing standards and patterns
- Payment processing optimized for security and compliance
