## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 completion (User Registration and Authentication):
- Strapi users-permissions plugin is fully configured and operational
- JWT authentication system is working with 7-day token expiration
- SendGrid email service is integrated for verification emails
- Email templates are created and tested
- Authentication endpoints are fully functional
- User registration, login, and password reset are working
- Comprehensive test coverage is in place (54/54 tests passing)

### User Profile Requirements
- User content type already exists with basic fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- User model includes: id, email, username, firstName, lastName, phone, isActive, emailVerified, role [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- User has relationships with addresses, orders, and wishlist [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- Need to extend User model with additional profile fields and preferences

### Data Models to Extend

#### Extended User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  phone?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  emailVerified: boolean;
  role: 'customer' | 'admin';
  // New profile fields
  profilePicture?: Media;
  dateOfBirth?: string;
  gender?: 'male' | 'female' | 'other' | 'prefer-not-to-say';
  bio?: string;
  website?: string;
  location?: string;
  timezone?: string;
  language?: string;
  currency?: string;
  // Relationships
  addresses: Address[];
  orders: Order[];
  wishlist: Product[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  privacySettings: PrivacySettings;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### UserPreferences Model
```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  id: string;
  user: User;
  // Communication preferences
  emailNotifications: boolean;
  smsNotifications: boolean;
  marketingEmails: boolean;
  orderUpdates: boolean;
  // Account settings
  twoFactorEnabled: boolean;
  loginNotifications: boolean;
  // Display preferences
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';
  language: string;
  currency: string;
  timezone: string;
  // Notification frequency
  notificationFrequency: 'immediate' | 'daily' | 'weekly';
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### PrivacySettings Model
```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  id: string;
  user: User;
  // Profile visibility
  profileVisibility: 'public' | 'private' | 'friends';
  showEmail: boolean;
  showPhone: boolean;
  showLocation: boolean;
  // Data sharing
  allowAnalytics: boolean;
  allowMarketing: boolean;
  allowThirdParty: boolean;
  // GDPR compliance
  dataRetentionConsent: boolean;
  marketingConsent: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
- Profile endpoints follow Strapi conventions: `/api/users/me` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#user-endpoints]
- Profile update endpoint: `PUT /api/users/me` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#user-endpoints]
- API responses follow Strapi's standard REST format [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- All profile endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests per minute for authenticated endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rate-limiting]

### File Locations

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Profile picture should use existing media management system

### Project Structure Notes
- Profile management extends existing User content type
- Services should contain business logic for profile operations
- Controllers should handle profile requests and responses
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Media integration should use existing Cloudflare R2 storage
- Privacy controls should be implemented at middleware level

### Business Rules
- Profile picture must be under 5MB and in supported formats
- Personal information updates require validation
- Privacy settings must be respected in all API responses
- Profile completion percentage should be tracked
- GDPR compliance for data retention and consent
- Two-factor authentication can be enabled/disabled
- Notification preferences must be respected
- Profile visibility controls must be enforced

### Security Considerations
- Profile data must be validated and sanitized
- Privacy settings must be enforced at API level
- Profile picture uploads must be secured
- Personal information must be encrypted at rest

- GDPR compliance for data access and deletion
- Rate limiting on profile update endpoints
- Input validation for all profile fields

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing user authentication system
- Leverage media management from Story 2.5 for profile pictures

- Testing frameworks and patterns: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test user profile CRUD operations
  - Test personal information management and validation
  - Test profile picture upload and processing
  - Test account preferences and settings
  - Test privacy controls and GDPR compliance
