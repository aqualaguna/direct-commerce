## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Builds on Epic 2 (Product Catalog Management) - product data and API endpoints
- Extends Epic 3 (User Management & Authentication) - user preferences and favorites
- Leverages Epic 4 (Shopping Cart & Checkout System) - cart integration
- Integrates with existing Strapi backend APIs for product data
- Focuses on frontend user experience and performance optimization

### Frontend Architecture
**Astro Frontend Structure** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#frontend-structure]
```typescript
// Astro Page Structure
interface ProductListingPage {
  path: '/products';
  layout: 'ProductLayout.astro';
  components: ['ProductGrid.astro', 'CategoryFilters.astro', 'Pagination.astro'];
  data: {
    products: Product[];
    categories: Category[];
    filters: FilterState;
    pagination: PaginationInfo;
  };
}

interface ProductDetailPage {
  path: '/products/[slug]';
  layout: 'ProductLayout.astro';
  components: ['ProductGallery.astro', 'ProductInfo.astro', 'RelatedProducts.astro'];
  data: {
    product: Product;
    variants: ProductVariant[];
    reviews: ProductReview[];
    relatedProducts: Product[];
  };
}

// Component Interfaces
interface ProductCard {
  product: Product;
  variant?: ProductVariant;
  showQuickAdd?: boolean;
  showWishlist?: boolean;
  layout: 'grid' | 'list' | 'compact';
  onAddToCart: (product: Product, quantity: number) => void;
  onAddToWishlist: (product: Product) => void;
}

interface ProductGallery {
  images: ProductImage[];
  selectedImage: number;
  showZoom?: boolean;
  showThumbnails?: boolean;
  onImageSelect: (index: number) => void;
  onZoomToggle: (enabled: boolean) => void;
}

interface SearchInput {
  query: string;
  suggestions: SearchSuggestion[];
  recentSearches: string[];
  onSearch: (query: string) => void;
  onSuggestionSelect: (suggestion: SearchSuggestion) => void;
  onClearHistory: () => void;
}

interface CategoryFilters {
  categories: Category[];
  selectedCategories: string[];
  priceRange: [number, number];
  attributes: FilterAttribute[];
  onFilterChange: (filters: FilterState) => void;
  onClearFilters: () => void;
}
```

### Testing Requirements
**Frontend Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#test-structure]
- **Test file location**: `apps/web/src/components/__tests__/`
- **Test standards**: Follow Vitest testing framework with Testing Library for component testing
- **Testing frameworks**: Vitest, @testing-library/astro, Playwright for E2E
- **Testing patterns**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for pages, E2E tests for user flows
- **Specific requirements**: Test all product interactions, validate responsive design, test search functionality
- **Coverage requirements**: 80% minimum coverage for product catalog components

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance]
- Product listing pages must load within 2 seconds
- Product images must be optimized and lazy-loaded
- Search results must appear within 500ms
- Image gallery must be smooth and responsive
- Implement virtual scrolling for large product lists

**Responsive Design Requirements**
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for all screen sizes (320px to 4K)
- Fast loading on mobile networks
- Accessible navigation and interactions

**SEO and Accessibility Requirements**
- Semantic HTML structure for all components
- Proper meta tags and structured data
- Alt text for all product images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility (WCAG AA)

**Version Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Astro 4.0+ for frontend framework
- React 18+ for interactive components
- Tailwind CSS 3.0+ for styling
- TypeScript 5.9.2+ for type safety
- Vitest for testing framework
- Playwright for E2E testing

### Integration Points
- **Strapi Backend**: Fetch product data from API endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#product-endpoints]
- **Cart Management**: Add products to cart via cart API
- **User Management**: User preferences and favorites integration
- **Search API**: Product search and filtering
- **Analytics**: Track product views and interactions
- **Image CDN**: Optimized product image delivery

### Project Structure Notes
- Product catalog components follow Astro component patterns
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- TypeScript interfaces shared with backend via packages/shared
- Component testing with Vitest and Testing Library
- Performance optimization with Astro's built-in features
