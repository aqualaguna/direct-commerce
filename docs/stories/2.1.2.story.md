## QA Review Summary

### Current Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Type Safety Improvements:**
- Reduced category module ESLint warnings from 139 to 126 (9% improvement)
- Successfully implemented type improvements for policy and route modules  
- Identified critical architectural issues with TypeScript interface compatibility

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Routes & Policies**: 16/16 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ‚ùå **Controllers & Services**: 60/60 tests failing due to TypeScript compilation errors
- üîÑ **Requires**: Deeper integration review with Strapi v5 Document Service API types

**Key Findings:**
1. **Interface Conflicts**: Custom TypeScript interfaces conflict with Strapi v5 native types
2. **Return Type Issues**: Method signatures incompatible with framework expectations  
3. **Type System Complexity**: Strapi's generated types require specialized handling
4. **Architectural Review Needed**: Full type safety requires framework-aware approach

**Recommendations:**
- Prioritize framework-native type solutions over custom interfaces
- Gradual type improvement approach rather than wholesale replacement
- Coordinate with Strapi v5 migration best practices
- Focus on incremental type safety improvements while maintaining functionality
