## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Builds on Story X.1 (Integration Test Infrastructure) - uses the established test framework
- Extends existing Jest configuration and testing standards
- Leverages established testing patterns from `docs/architecture/test-standard.md`
- Integrates with existing Strapi 5 Document Service API patterns

### Testing Architecture
**User Integration Test Example** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
```typescript
// User Integration Test Example
describe('User Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should create user and verify database record', async () => {
    const userData = {
      username: 'testuser',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'securepassword123',
      firstName: 'Test',
      lastName: 'User'
    };
    
    // Create user via API
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send({ data: userData })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Verify database record
    const dbRecord = await testDb.verifyRecord('api::user.user', {
      documentId: response.body.data.documentId
    });
    
    expect(dbRecord.username).toBe(userData.username);
    expect(dbRecord.email).toBe(userData.email);
    expect(dbRecord.firstName).toBe(userData.firstName);
  });
});
```

**User Activity Integration Test Example** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
```typescript
// User Activity Integration Test Example
describe('User Activity Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should track user activity and verify database record', async () => {
    const user = await testFactories.createUser();
    const activityData = {
      user: user.documentId,
      action: 'login',
      ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
      userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
    };
    
    // Create activity via API
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/user-activities')
      .send({ data: activityData })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Verify database record
    const dbRecord = await testDb.verifyRecord('api::user-activity.user-activity', {
      documentId: response.body.data.documentId
    });
    
    expect(dbRecord.user.documentId).toBe(user.documentId);
    expect(dbRecord.action).toBe(activityData.action);
  });
});
```

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
- Use real PostgreSQL database connection
- Start Strapi dev server before test execution
- Verify database records after API operations
- Clean up test data after each test
- Follow established naming conventions and patterns
- Implement proper error handling and timeout management
- Use test data factories for consistent test data
- Implement test isolation through database transactions

**User-Specific Test Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations with database verification
- Test user authentication and security workflows
- Test user profile management and validation
- Test user preferences and settings
- Test user role and permission management
- Test user activity tracking and analytics
- Test user privacy and data protection
- Test user engagement metrics and behavior

### Technical Constraints
**Strapi 5 Document Service API** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#document-service-api-migration]
- Use Document Service API instead of deprecated Entity Service API
- Use `documentId` instead of numeric IDs
- Use `status` filters instead of `publishedAt` checks
- Implement proper draft/publish testing patterns
- Handle content type relationships correctly

**User Management Data Models**
- Test user authentication and security
- Test user profile validation and constraints
- Test user preference inheritance and defaults
- Test user role and permission validation
- Test user activity privacy and compliance
- Test user behavior analytics and metrics
- Test user data protection and encryption
- Test user engagement tracking and reporting
