## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion:
- Product management system is fully implemented with CRUD operations
- Product validation and business rules are enforced
- Product status management (active/inactive/draft) is implemented
- Product metadata and SEO fields are configured
- Product bulk operations (import/export) are functional
- Comprehensive test coverage is in place for product management

### Category Management Requirements
- Category content type already exists with basic fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- Core fields: id, name, slug, description, image, isActive, sortOrder [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- Hierarchical structure: parent and children relationships [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- Product relationship: has many Products [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- SEO component: structured SEO metadata [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]

### API Specifications
- REST API endpoints will follow Strapi conventions: `/api/categories` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#category-endpoints]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format with pagination metadata [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- Authentication required for admin operations [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- JWT Bearer token authentication for protected endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]

### File Locations
- Category controller: `apps/strapi/src/api/category/controllers/category.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Category service: `apps/strapi/src/api/category/services/category.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Category routes: `apps/strapi/src/api/category/routes/category.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Category content type: `apps/strapi/src/api/category/content-types/category/schema.json` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Category policies: `apps/strapi/src/api/category/policies/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/api/category/controllers/category.test.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test CRUD operations, hierarchy management, relationships, navigation, and sorting

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Category hierarchy should prevent circular references
- Status transitions should be validated (active → inactive)
- Sorting should be efficient for large category trees
- Breadcrumb generation should be optimized for performance

### Project Structure Notes
- Category content type already exists and needs to be enhanced
- Controller should follow Strapi's standard patterns
- Services should contain business logic for hierarchy management
- Policies should enforce proper authorization
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Navigation and breadcrumb services should be separate utilities

### Business Rules
- Category names must be unique within the same parent category
- Category hierarchy cannot have circular references
- Root categories (no parent) should be allowed
- Category status transitions: active → inactive (no reverse)
- Sort order should be numeric and allow reordering
- Breadcrumbs should show full path from root to current category
- Category deletion should handle orphaned products appropriately

### Hierarchy Management
- Parent-child relationships should be properly validated
- Category depth should be reasonable (max 5 levels recommended)
- Category movement should update all child relationships
- Category deletion should cascade to children or reassign them
- Category queries should support tree traversal

## Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest for backend, unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for CRUD operations, hierarchy management, relationship handling, navigation generation, sorting logic
