# Story 2.5: Product Media Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** store administrator,
**I want** comprehensive product image and media management capabilities,
**so that** I can effectively manage product visuals, optimize images for performance, and provide customers with high-quality product galleries.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multiple product images per product
2. Image upload and processing
3. Image optimization and resizing
4. Media library management
5. Product gallery and thumbnail generation

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement multiple product images per product (AC: 1)
  - [x] Extend Product content type to support multiple images array
  - [x] Create image upload endpoints for product media
  - [x] Implement image validation and file type restrictions
  - [x] Add image ordering and primary image designation
  - [x] Test multiple image upload and management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 completion:
- Product search and filtering system is fully implemented
- Full-text search across product fields is functional
- Category-based, price range, and attribute filtering are working
- Search result ranking and relevance algorithms are operational
- Comprehensive test coverage is in place
- All search and filtering features are production-ready

### Product Media Requirements
- Product content type already has `images: media[]` field [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Media component interface is defined with url, alternativeText, width, height, mime, size [Source: architecture/data-models.md#media-component]
- Product has relationship with many Media (images) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Need to implement comprehensive media management and optimization

### API Specifications
- REST API endpoints will follow Strapi conventions: `/api/products/{id}/media` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#product-endpoints]
- Media upload endpoints: `/api/upload` for file uploads [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format with pagination metadata [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- Media endpoints should be protected with JWT Bearer token authentication [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- File upload size limits and type restrictions should be configured

### File Storage Configuration
- Cloudflare R2 for media and file storage [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage]
- Cost-effective alternative to S3 with Cloudflare integration
- Need to configure R2 bucket and credentials
- Implement proper file organization and naming conventions

### File Locations
- Media controller: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/controllers/media.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Media service: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/services/media.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Media routes: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/routes/media.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Upload extensions: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/upload/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Media component: `apps/strapi/src/components/shared/media.json` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/controllers/media.test.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test media upload, processing, optimization, and gallery functionality
- Test file validation, error handling, and performance

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Cloudflare R2 for file storage [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage]
- Image optimization should be fast and efficient
- Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF)
- Responsive image generation for different screen sizes
- File size limits and upload restrictions

### Project Structure Notes
- Media functionality will extend existing product API
- Services should contain business logic for media processing and optimization
- Controllers should handle media upload requests and responses
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Upload extensions should be in the extensions directory
- Media component should be in the shared components directory

### Business Rules
- Maximum file size: 10MB per image
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF
- Minimum image dimensions: 100x100 pixels
- Maximum image dimensions: 4000x4000 pixels
- Automatic thumbnail generation for gallery views
- Primary image designation for product listings
- Image ordering for product galleries
- Alt text requirement for accessibility

### Performance Considerations
- Image optimization should be asynchronous
- Thumbnail generation should be on-demand
- CDN integration with Cloudflare for fast image delivery
- Lazy loading for product galleries
- Progressive image loading for better UX
- Image caching strategies for improved performance

## Testing
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest 30+ with Supertest for API testing
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test image upload with various file types and sizes
  - Test image validation and error handling
  - Test image optimization and thumbnail generation
  - Test media library search and filtering
  - Test product gallery functionality
  - Test performance with large image files
  - Test responsive image generation
  - Test file storage integration with Cloudflare R2
