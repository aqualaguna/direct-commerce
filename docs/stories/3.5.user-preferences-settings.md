- **Testing frameworks**: Jest, supertest, @strapi/test-utils
- **Testing patterns**: Unit tests for services, integration tests for API endpoints, E2E tests for user flows
- **Specific requirements**: Test all preference CRUD operations, validate GDPR compliance, test preference inheritance and defaults
- **Coverage requirements**: 70% minimum coverage for all preference-related code

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance]
- Preference operations must complete within 200ms
- Implement caching for frequently accessed preferences
- Use database indexes on preference fields for fast queries
- Optimize preference updates to minimize database writes

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security]
- All preference endpoints require JWT authentication
- GDPR compliance with proper consent tracking
- Data encryption for sensitive preference data
- Audit logging for all preference changes

**Version Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Strapi 4.25+ for built-in user management features
- Node.js 20+ for modern JavaScript features
- TypeScript 5.9.2+ for type safety
- Jest 30+ for testing framework

### Integration Points
- **User Authentication System**: Leverage existing JWT-based authentication [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- **Email Notification System**: Integrate with notification service for preference-based email delivery

- **Database Migration System**: Use existing migration system for preference schema updates
- **API Documentation**: Extend OpenAPI documentation with preference endpoints

### Project Structure Notes
- All preference-related code follows established Strapi patterns
