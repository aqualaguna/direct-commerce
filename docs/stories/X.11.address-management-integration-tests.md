# Story X.11: Address Management Integration Tests

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for Address Management module that verify address creation, validation, and management functionality,
**so that** we can ensure address management functionality works correctly in a real environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Address module integration tests cover all CRUD operations
2. Address validation and geocoding are tested
3. Address privacy and security are tested
4. All tests verify database records are created/updated/deleted correctly
5. Tests follow established testing standards and patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Address Management Integration Tests (AC: 1, 4, 5)
- [ ] Create address integration tests in `apps/strapi/src/api/address/__tests__/address.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Test address creation with database verification
- [ ] Test address retrieval and filtering
- [ ] Test address updates and validation
- [ ] Test address deletion and cleanup
- [ ] Test address validation and constraints
- [ ] Test address bulk operations
- [ ] Test address performance optimization

### Task 2: Address Validation and Geocoding (AC: 2, 4, 5)
- [ ] Test address validation rules and constraints
- [ ] Test address geocoding and coordinates
- [ ] Test address format validation
- [ ] Test address country and region validation
- [ ] Test address postal code validation
- [ ] Test address validation error handling

### Task 3: Address Privacy and Security (AC: 3, 4, 5)
- [ ] Test address privacy settings and access control
- [ ] Test address data encryption and security
- [ ] Test address user association and ownership
- [ ] Test address data retention and cleanup
- [ ] Test address compliance and auditing
- [ ] Test address security breach prevention

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Builds on Story X.1 (Integration Test Infrastructure) - uses the established test framework
- Extends existing Jest configuration and testing standards
- Leverages established testing patterns from `docs/architecture/test-standard.md`
- Integrates with existing Strapi 5 Document Service API patterns

### Testing Architecture
**Address Integration Test Example** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
```typescript
// Address Integration Test Example
describe('Address Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should create address and verify database record', async () => {
    const user = await testFactories.createUser();
    const addressData = {
      user: user.documentId,
      street: '123 Main Street',
      city: 'New York',
      state: 'NY',
      postalCode: '10001',
      country: 'US',
      isDefault: true
    };
    
    // Create address via API
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/addresses')
      .send({ data: addressData })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Verify database record
    const dbRecord = await testDb.verifyRecord('api::address.address', {
      documentId: response.body.data.documentId
    });
    
    expect(dbRecord.user.documentId).toBe(user.documentId);
    expect(dbRecord.street).toBe(addressData.street);
    expect(dbRecord.city).toBe(addressData.city);
    expect(dbRecord.isDefault).toBe(addressData.isDefault);
  });
});
```

### File Locations and Project Structure
**Address Management Test Structure**
```

    ├── __tests__/
    │   └── address.integration.test.ts

    └── routes/
```

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
- Use real PostgreSQL database connection
- Start Strapi dev server before test execution
- Verify database records after API operations
- Clean up test data after each test
- Follow established naming conventions and patterns
- Implement proper error handling and timeout management
- Use test data factories for consistent test data
- Implement test isolation through database transactions

**Address-Specific Test Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations with database verification
- Test address validation and geocoding
- Test address privacy and security
- Test address bulk operations
- Test address performance optimization

### Technical Constraints
**Strapi 5 Document Service API** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#document-service-api-migration]
- Use Document Service API instead of deprecated Entity Service API
- Use `documentId` instead of numeric IDs
- Use `status` filters instead of `publishedAt` checks
- Implement proper draft/publish testing patterns
- Handle content type relationships correctly

**Address Management Data Models**
- Test address validation and geocoding
- Test address privacy and security
- Test address user associations
- Test data integrity and performance optimization
