m# Story X.11: Address Management Integration Tests

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for Address Management module that verify address creation, validation, and management functionality,
**so that** we can ensure address management functionality works correctly in a real environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Address module integration tests cover all CRUD operations
2. Address validation and geocoding are tested
3. Address privacy and security are tested
4. All tests verify database records are created/updated/deleted correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Builds on Story X.1 (Integration Test Infrastructure) - uses the established test framework
- Extends existing Jest configuration and testing standards
- Leverages established testing patterns from `docs/architecture/test-standard.md`
- Integrates with existing Strapi 5 Document Service API patterns

### Testing Architecture
**Address Integration Test Example** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
```typescript
// Address Integration Test Example
describe('Address Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should create address and verify database record', async () => {
    const user = await testFactories.createUser();
    const addressData = {
      user: user.documentId,
      street: '123 Main Street',
      city: 'New York',
      state: 'NY',
      postalCode: '10001',
      country: 'US',
      isDefault: true
    };
    
    // Create address via API
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/addresses')
      .send({ data: addressData })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Verify database record
    const dbRecord = await testDb.verifyRecord('api::address.address', {
      documentId: response.body.data.documentId
    });
    
    expect(dbRecord.user.documentId).toBe(user.documentId);
    expect(dbRecord.street).toBe(addressData.street);
    expect(dbRecord.city).toBe(addressData.city);
    expect(dbRecord.isDefault).toBe(addressData.isDefault);
  });
});
```

### File Locations and Project Structure
**Address Management Test Structure**
```
apps/strapi/src/api/
└── address/
    ├── __tests__/
    │   └── address.integration.test.ts
    ├── controllers/
    ├── services/
    └── routes/
```

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
- Use real PostgreSQL database connection
- Start Strapi dev server before test execution
- Verify database records after API operations
- Clean up test data after each test
- Follow established naming conventions and patterns
- Implement proper error handling and timeout management
- Use test data factories for consistent test data
- Implement test isolation through database transactions

**Address-Specific Test Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations with database verification
- Test address validation and geocoding
- Test address privacy and security
- Test address bulk operations
- Test address performance optimization

### Technical Constraints
**Strapi 5 Document Service API** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#document-service-api-migration]
- Use Document Service API instead of deprecated Entity Service API
- Use `documentId` instead of numeric IDs
- Use `status` filters instead of `publishedAt` checks
- Implement proper draft/publish testing patterns
- Handle content type relationships correctly

**Address Management Data Models**
- Test address validation and geocoding
- Test address privacy and security
- Test address user associations
- Test data integrity and performance optimization
