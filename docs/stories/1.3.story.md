## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- All core content types (Product, Category, User, Address) have been created and configured
- Database migrations are in place for all content types
- Strapi automatically generates REST API endpoints for all content types
- Admin panel interfaces are automatically generated for content management
- Testing framework (Jest) is configured and working
- All content type relationships are properly configured

### API Specifications
- Strapi REST API will be the primary API layer [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-style]
- API endpoints will be auto-generated by Strapi based on content types [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-style]
- Authentication using Strapi Auth + JWT [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format with pagination metadata [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- Base API URL structure: `/api/{content-type}` (e.g., `/api/products`, `/api/categories`) [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#product-endpoints]

### Authentication & Security
- JWT Bearer token authentication for protected endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- JWT tokens should be included in Authorization header: `Bearer {token}` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- Strapi's built-in users-permissions plugin handles authentication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- Security headers should be implemented using helmet.js middleware [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]

### File Locations
- API configuration: `apps/strapi/config/api.js` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Middleware configuration: `apps/strapi/config/middlewares.js` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Custom middlewares: `apps/strapi/src/middlewares/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Authentication policies: `apps/strapi/src/policies/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- User permissions extensions: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/users-permissions/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test files should be co-located with source files [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for authentication and authorization logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints with authentication
- Test rate limiting and security headers functionality
- Test CORS configuration with frontend requests

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- JWT tokens should have appropriate expiration times
- CORS should be configured for frontend domain (to be determined)
- Rate limiting should be reasonable for ecommerce usage patterns
- Security headers should follow OWASP recommendations

### Project Structure Notes
- Strapi automatically generates API endpoints based on content types
- Custom middlewares can be added to `apps/strapi/src/middlewares/`
- Policies should be created in `apps/strapi/src/policies/` for authorization
- Admin panel permissions are managed through Strapi's built-in system
- API documentation will be auto-generated by Strapi

## Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest for backend, unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for authentication logic, integration tests for API endpoints with auth, CORS testing, rate limiting tests, security header validation

4. **Authentication Policies**: Created four policies in `src/policies/`:
   - `is-authenticated.ts`: Checks if user is logged in
