## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 1 completion:
- Strapi backend foundation is fully established with TypeScript support
- Core content types (Product, Category, User, Address) are created and configured
- REST API endpoints are properly configured with authentication and security
- JWT authentication is implemented with proper token expiration
- CORS settings are configured for frontend integration
- Security headers and rate limiting are implemented
- Admin panel permissions and roles are configured
- Development environment and tooling are fully set up
- Comprehensive test coverage is in place (40 tests)
- Database migration system is configured

### Product Management Requirements
- Product content type already exists with basic fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Core fields: id, title, slug, description, shortDescription, price, comparePrice, sku, inventory, isActive, featured [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Media relationships: images array for product images [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Category relationship: belongs to one Category [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- SEO component: structured SEO metadata [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]

### API Specifications
- REST API endpoints will follow Strapi conventions: `/api/products` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#product-endpoints]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format with pagination metadata [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- Authentication required for admin operations [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- JWT Bearer token authentication for protected endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]

### File Locations
- Product controller: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/controllers/product.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Product service: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/services/product.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Product routes: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/routes/product.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Product content type: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/content-types/product/schema.json` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Product policies: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/policies/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/api/product/controllers/product.test.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test CRUD operations, validation, status management, and bulk operations

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Product validation should enforce business rules (positive prices, valid SKUs, etc.)
- Status transitions should be validated (draft → active → inactive)
- Bulk operations should handle large datasets efficiently
- SEO fields should follow best practices for search engine optimization

### Project Structure Notes
- Product content type already exists and needs to be extended
- Controller should follow Strapi's standard patterns
- Services should contain business logic
- Policies should enforce proper authorization
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Bulk operations should be implemented as separate endpoints

### Business Rules
- Product prices must be positive numbers
- SKU must be unique across all products
- Product status transitions: draft → active → inactive (no reverse)
- Inventory cannot be negative
- SEO fields should have reasonable length limits
- Bulk operations should validate all records before processing

## Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest for backend, unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for CRUD operations, validation logic, status management, SEO functionality, bulk operations

### Developer Perspective
The story provides sufficient context for implementation. A developer would understand:
- What to build (comprehensive product management system)
- Where to build it (specific file locations)
- How to test it (comprehensive testing requirements)
- Technical constraints and business rules to follow

**Final Assessment: READY** - The story provides sufficient context for implementation with clear technical guidance, proper references, and comprehensive business requirements.
