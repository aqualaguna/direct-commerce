## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The development environment and tooling updates demonstrate excellent implementation of new coding and test standards. All configurations have been properly updated to support TypeScript 5.9.2+, Jest 30+, and modern development practices. The tooling provides comprehensive quality checks and maintains backward compatibility while enforcing new standards.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary as the implementation already meets the new standards requirements. The configurations demonstrate:
- Comprehensive ESLint configuration with TypeScript 5.9.2+ support
- Modern Prettier configuration with shared config integration
- Jest 30+ configuration with ES modules support and Document Service API mocking
- Enhanced development scripts with quality automation
- Updated documentation with clear setup instructions

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ PASS - All new standards implemented correctly
- Project Structure: ✓ PASS - Proper configuration organization and integration
- Testing Strategy: ✓ PASS - Jest 30+ with comprehensive test coverage requirements
