## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 (Address Management System):
- Address management system is being implemented
- Address content type with user relationships is being created
- Address validation and formatting services are in development
- Default address selection and address book management are being implemented
- This story will build on the user management foundation for role-based access control

### Role and Permission Requirements
- User model already has basic role field: `role: 'customer' | 'admin'` [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- Strapi users-permissions plugin is configured and operational [Source: architecture/implementation-guide.md#step-5]
- Role system is extensible for future admin features [Source: architecture/data-models.md#design-decisions]
- Permission checking is already implemented in coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#strapi-policies]
- **Strapi v4.8+ provides built-in RBAC with predefined roles: Super Admin, Editor, Author** [Source: strapi.io]
- **Custom roles and permissions are now available for free in Community Edition** [Source: strapi.io]
- **Admin panel provides built-in role management interface** [Source: docs.strapi.io]

### Data Models to Extend

#### Extended User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  phone?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  emailVerified: boolean;
  role: 'customer' | 'admin' | 'manager' | 'support' | 'moderator';
  permissions: Permission[];
  roleAssignedBy?: User;
  roleAssignedAt?: string;
  roleExpiresAt?: string;
  addresses: Address[];
  orders: Order[];
  wishlist: Product[];
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### Strapi Built-in Roles (v4.8+)
```typescript
// Strapi provides these predefined roles out-of-the-box:
interface StrapiRole {
  id: string;
  name: 'Super Admin' | 'Editor' | 'Author' | string; // Custom roles
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  isActive: boolean;
  isSystem: boolean; // Predefined roles cannot be deleted
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

// Custom roles for ecommerce platform
interface EcommerceRole extends StrapiRole {
  name: 'customer' | 'manager' | 'support' | 'moderator' | string;
  // Additional ecommerce-specific fields
  ecommercePermissions: EcommercePermission[];
}
```

#### Permission Model
```typescript
interface Permission {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  resource: string;
  action: string;
  conditions?: object;
  isActive: boolean;
  roles: Role[];
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

- Role management: Navigate to **Settings > Administration panel > Roles** [Source: docs.strapi.io]
- Custom role creation and permission assignment through admin interface
- Custom conditions for permissions can be defined using handlers [Source: docs.strapi.io]
- All role/permission endpoints require admin authentication [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]

### File Locations

- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/users-permissions/test/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]

- Test role management, permission checking, and access control

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.8+ (required for custom roles and permissions) [Source: strapi.io]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Role system uses Strapi's built-in RBAC system [Source: strapi.io]
- Custom roles and permissions available in Community Edition [Source: strapi.io]
- Admin panel provides built-in role management interface [Source: docs.strapi.io]

### Business Rules
- Strapi predefined roles (Super Admin, Editor, Author) cannot be deleted or modified [Source: strapi.io]
- Custom roles can be created and managed through admin panel [Source: docs.strapi.io]
- Role assignments require admin privileges
- Permission inheritance follows Strapi's built-in hierarchy
- Role changes should be audited and logged
- Permission conflicts should be resolved by most restrictive rule
- Custom conditions can be applied to any permission [Source: docs.strapi.io]

### Security Considerations
- Role and permission data must be validated and sanitized
- Permission checking must be enforced at all API endpoints
- Role assignment must be restricted to authorized admins
- Role changes must be logged for audit purposes
- Admin panel access must be protected

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing user management system
- Use Strapi's built-in RBAC system [Source: strapi.io]
- Configure admin panel for role management [Source: docs.strapi.io]
- Connect with audit logging system
- Leverage Strapi's custom conditions for permissions [Source: docs.strapi.io]

## Testing
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest 30+ with Supertest for API testing
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test Strapi's built-in RBAC functionality
  - Test custom role creation and management
  - Test admin panel role management interface
  - Test custom role assignment workflows
  - Test permission inheritance and hierarchy
  - Test custom permission conditions
  - Test integration with existing user system
