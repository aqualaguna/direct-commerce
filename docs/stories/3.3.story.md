## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.2 (User Profile Management):
- User profile management system is being implemented
- User content type is being extended with additional profile fields
- Profile picture upload and media integration is in development
- Account preferences and privacy controls are being implemented
- GDPR compliance features are being added
- This story will build on the user management foundation for address-specific functionality

### Address Management Requirements
- Address content type already exists with comprehensive fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#address-model]
- Address model includes: id, user, type, firstName, lastName, company, address1, address2, city, state, postalCode, country, phone, isDefault [Source: architecture/data-models.md#address-model]
- Address has relationship with User (belongs to one User) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#address-model]
- AddressComponent interface is defined for reuse [Source: architecture/data-models.md#address-component]
- Address endpoints are already defined in API specification [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#address-endpoints]

### Data Models

#### Address Model (Already Defined)
```typescript
interface Address {
  id: string;
  user: User;
  type: 'shipping' | 'billing' | 'both';
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  company?: string;
  address1: string;
  address2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postalCode: string;
  country: string;
  phone: string;
  isDefault: boolean;
}
```

#### AddressComponent (Reusable Component)
```typescript
interface AddressComponent {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  company?: string;
  address1: string;
  address2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postalCode: string;
  country: string;
  phone: string;
}
```

#### Address Validation Response
```typescript
interface AddressValidationResponse {
  isValid: boolean;
  formattedAddress: AddressComponent;
  suggestions?: AddressComponent[];
  errors?: string[];
  confidence: number; // 0-1
}
```

### API Specifications
- Address endpoints follow Strapi conventions: `/api/addresses` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#address-endpoints]
- Address creation endpoint: `POST /api/addresses` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#address-endpoints]
- API responses follow Strapi's standard REST format [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- All address endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests per minute for authenticated endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rate-limiting]

### File Locations
- Address controller: `apps/strapi/src/api/address/controllers/address.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Address service: `apps/strapi/src/api/address/services/address.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Address routes: `apps/strapi/src/api/address/routes/address.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Address validation service: `apps/strapi/src/api/address/services/validation.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Address component: `apps/strapi/src/components/shared/address.json` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/api/address/controllers/address.test.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test address CRUD operations, validation, default selection, and management

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Address validation should use external service (Google Maps, SmartyStreets, etc.)
- Address formatting should follow international standards
- Default address logic should handle type-specific defaults
- Address book should support pagination for large address lists

### Project Structure Notes
- Address management extends existing Address content type
- Services should contain business logic for address operations and validation
- Controllers should handle address requests and responses
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Address component should be reusable across the application
- Validation service should integrate with external address validation APIs

### Business Rules
- Users can have multiple addresses of different types
- Only one default address per type per user
- Address validation should be performed on creation/update
- Address formatting should follow country-specific standards
- Address book should support search and filtering
- Address import/export should support common formats (CSV, JSON)
- Address deletion should check for active orders
- Address updates should maintain referential integrity

### Security Considerations
- Address data must be validated and sanitized
- Address access must be restricted to owner
- Address validation should not expose sensitive information
- Address import should validate file formats and content
- Rate limiting on address validation endpoints
- Input validation for all address fields
- Address data should be encrypted at rest
- Audit logging for address changes

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing user management system
- Connect with order system for address validation
- Integrate with external address validation services
- Connect with shipping calculation system
- Use existing database schema and relationships
- Integrate with notification system for address changes

### External Services Integration
- **Address Validation Service**: Google Maps API, SmartyStreets, or similar
- **Postal Code Validation**: Country-specific postal code validation
- **Address Formatting**: International address formatting standards
- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates for mapping

### Address Validation Features
- Real-time address validation
- Postal code verification
- Address formatting and standardization
- Address suggestions for typos
- Country-specific validation rules
- Confidence scoring for validation results

## Testing
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest 30+ with Supertest for API testing
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test address CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Test address validation and formatting
  - Test default address selection and management
  - Test address book functionality and organization
  - Test address import/export features
  - Test address validation with external services
  - Test address type management (shipping/billing/both)
  - Test address search and filtering
  - Test integration with user management system
  - Test address data validation and sanitization
