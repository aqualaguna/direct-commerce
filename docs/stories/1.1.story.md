## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
N/A - This is the first story in the project

### Data Models
Based on the architecture documents, the following data models will be implemented in subsequent stories:
- Product Model: Core product information with pricing, inventory, and media [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Category Model: Product categorization and navigation structure [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- User Model: Customer account management (Strapi built-in)
- Order Model: Order management and tracking (to be defined)
- Media Model: File and image management (Strapi built-in)

### API Specifications
- Strapi REST API will be the primary API layer [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-style]
- Authentication using Strapi Auth + JWT [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- API endpoints will be auto-generated by Strapi based on content types

### Component Specifications
- Strapi components will be defined in `src/components/` directory [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Shared components will be in `packages/ui/src/components/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#packages-structure]
- Frontend components will be in `apps/web/src/components/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#frontend-structure]

### File Locations
- Strapi backend: `apps/strapi/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]
- Frontend (future): `apps/web/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]
- Shared packages: `packages/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#monorepo-structure]
- Configuration files: `packages/config/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#packages-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Frontend testing: Vitest + Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-testing]
- E2E testing: Playwright [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#e2e-testing]
- Test files should be co-located with source files

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 18+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- PostgreSQL version: 15+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database]
- TypeScript version: 5.3+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: Co-located with source files
- Test standards: Jest for backend, Vitest for frontend, Playwright for E2E
- Testing frameworks: Jest 29+, Vitest 1.0+, Playwright 1.40+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-section]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for API endpoints, E2E tests for critical user flows
