## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 2 completion (Product Catalog Management):
- Product management system is fully implemented
- Category management with hierarchical structure is operational
- Inventory tracking and management is functional
- Product search and filtering capabilities are working
- Product media management is in development
- Product variants and options are being implemented
- All product catalog features are ready for user integration

### Authentication Requirements
- Use Strapi's built-in users-permissions plugin for authentication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- JWT-based authentication system with configurable expiration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- User content type already exists with authentication fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- Authentication endpoints are already defined in API specification [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication-endpoints]
- **Note: Most authentication functionality is provided out-of-the-box by Strapi**

### Strapi Built-in Authentication Features

#### Users-Permissions Plugin Configuration
```javascript
// config/plugins.js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  'users-permissions': {
    config: {
      jwt: {
        expiresIn: '7d',
      },
      ratelimit: {
        max: 5,
        windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Built-in Authentication Endpoints
- `/api/auth/local` - User login with email/username and password
- `/api/auth/local/register` - User registration
- `/api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `/api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset confirmation
- `/api/auth/email-confirmation` - Email verification
- `/api/auth/connect/:provider` - OAuth provider connection

### API Specifications
- Authentication endpoints follow Strapi's standard REST format [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- All protected endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- Authentication responses include JWT token and user data [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication-endpoints]
- Rate limiting and security measures are configured

### File Locations
- Authentication configuration: `apps/strapi/config/plugins.js` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- User controller extensions: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/users-permissions/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Email templates: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/users-permissions/email-templates/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Custom business logic: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/users-permissions/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/extensions/users-permissions/test/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test authentication flows, security measures, and error handling

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- JWT token expiration: 7 days (configurable)
- Password requirements: Minimum 8 characters, complexity rules
- Email verification required for account activation
- Rate limiting: 5 requests per 15 minutes for auth endpoints

### Project Structure Notes
- Authentication uses Strapi's built-in users-permissions plugin (minimal development required)
- Extensions should be in the extensions directory for custom business logic
- Email templates should be in the users-permissions extensions directory
- Custom validation and business rules should extend existing Strapi functionality
- Test files should be co-located with source files

### Business Rules
- Email verification required before account activation (handled by Strapi)
- Passwords must meet minimum security requirements (handled by Strapi)
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days (configurable in Strapi)
- Rate limiting applies to authentication endpoints (handled by Strapi)
- Account deactivation preserves user data (custom extension needed)
- Admin accounts have elevated permissions (handled by Strapi roles)
- Password reset requires email verification (handled by Strapi)
- Session management handles concurrent logins (handled by Strapi)

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookies recommended)
- Password hashing using bcrypt (handled by Strapi)
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (handled by Strapi)
- CSRF protection for forms (handled by Strapi)
- Input validation and sanitization (handled by Strapi)
- Secure email templates for verification (custom development needed)
- Audit logging for authentication events (handled by Strapi)
- Account lockout after failed attempts (handled by Strapi)

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing user management system (handled by Strapi)
- Connect with email service for verification emails (custom development needed)
- Integrate with admin panel for user management (handled by Strapi)
- Connect with order system for user-specific data (handled by Strapi relationships)
- Use existing database schema for user data (handled by Strapi)
- Integrate with logging system for audit trails (handled by Strapi)

### Email Templates Required
- Account verification email
- Password reset email
- Welcome email for new users
- Account activation confirmation
- Security alert emails

## Testing
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest 30+ with Supertest for API testing
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test Strapi authentication endpoints (registration, login, password reset)
  - Test email service integration and delivery
  - Test custom email template rendering
  - Test custom business logic extensions
  - Test account activation/deactivation workflow
  - Test JWT token management (handled by Strapi)
  - Test rate limiting and security measures (handled by Strapi)
  - Test integration with existing user data and relationships
