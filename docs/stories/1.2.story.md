## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Strapi backend is properly initialized with TypeScript support
- PostgreSQL database connection is established and tested
- Project structure follows monorepo pattern with Nx
- Development environment is configured with ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
- All foundation tasks completed successfully

### Data Models
Based on the architecture documents, the following data models will be implemented:

**Product Model:**
- Core fields: id, title, slug, description, shortDescription, price (decimal), comparePrice, sku, inventory, isActive, featured [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Media relationships: images array for product images [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Category relationship: belongs to one Category [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- SEO component: structured SEO metadata [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]

**Category Model:**
- Core fields: id, name, slug, description, image, isActive, sortOrder [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- Hierarchical structure: parent and children relationships [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]
- Product relationship: has many Products [Source: architecture/data-models.md#category-model]

**User Model (Extended):**
- Base Strapi User fields: username, email, password, role [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- Ecommerce extensions: addresses, preferences, order history (to be implemented in future stories)

**Media Model:**
- Strapi built-in Media content type for file and image management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage]

### API Specifications
- Strapi REST API will be the primary API layer [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-style]
- API endpoints will be auto-generated by Strapi based on content types [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-style]
- Authentication using Strapi Auth + JWT [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format

### Component Specifications
- Strapi components will be defined in `apps/strapi/src/components/` directory [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Content types will be defined in `apps/strapi/src/api/` directory [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Project Structure Notes
- Content types must follow Strapi's naming conventions and structure
- Database migrations should be version-controlled and reversible
- API endpoints will follow Strapi's REST conventions
- Admin panel configuration should prioritize user experience for content management

## Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
