- Low stock alerts and notifications are functional
- Inventory history and audit trail are working
- Stock reservation for pending orders is implemented
- Inventory reporting and analytics are operational
- Comprehensive test coverage is in place (14 tests)
- All inventory management features are production-ready

### Product Search Requirements
- Product content type already exists with searchable fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Core searchable fields: title, description, shortDescription, sku [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Category relationship exists for category-based filtering [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Price field exists for price range filtering [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Need to implement full-text search and advanced filtering capabilities

### API Specifications
- REST API endpoints will follow Strapi conventions: `/api/products/search` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#product-endpoints]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format with pagination metadata [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- Search endpoints should be publicly accessible [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
