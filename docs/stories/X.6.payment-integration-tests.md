# Story X.6: Payment Integration Tests

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for Payment modules that verify payment processing, methods, confirmations, and review workflows,
**so that** we can ensure payment functionality works correctly in a real environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Payment method integration tests cover all CRUD operations
2. Payment confirmation workflows are tested
3. Payment review and approval processes are tested
4. Manual payment handling is tested
5. Payment comments and communication are tested
6. All tests verify database records are created/updated/deleted correctly
7. Tests follow established testing standards and patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Builds on Story X.1 (Integration Test Infrastructure) - uses the established test framework
- Extends existing Jest configuration and testing standards
- Leverages established testing patterns from `docs/architecture/test-standard.md`
- Integrates with existing Strapi 5 Document Service API patterns

### Testing Architecture
**Payment Method Integration Test Example** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
```typescript
// Payment Method Integration Test Example
describe('Payment Method Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should create payment method and verify database record', async () => {
    const user = await testFactories.createUser();
    const paymentMethodData = {
      user: user.documentId,
      type: 'credit_card',
      lastFour: '1234',
      expiryMonth: 12,
      expiryYear: 2025,
      isDefault: true
    };
    
    // Create payment method via API
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/basic-payment-methods')
      .send({ data: paymentMethodData })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Verify database record
    const dbRecord = await testDb.verifyRecord('api::basic-payment-method.basic-payment-method', {
      documentId: response.body.data.documentId
    });
    
    expect(dbRecord.user.documentId).toBe(user.documentId);
    expect(dbRecord.type).toBe(paymentMethodData.type);
    expect(dbRecord.lastFour).toBe(paymentMethodData.lastFour);
  });
});
```

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
- Use real PostgreSQL database connection
- Start Strapi dev server before test execution
- Verify database records after API operations
- Clean up test data after each test
- Follow established naming conventions and patterns
- Implement proper error handling and timeout management
- Use test data factories for consistent test data
- Implement test isolation through database transactions

**Payment-Specific Test Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations with database verification
- Test payment method security and encryption
- Test payment confirmation workflows
- Test payment review and approval processes
- Test manual payment handling
- Test payment comments and communication
- Test payment validation and constraints

### Technical Constraints
**Strapi 5 Document Service API** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#document-service-api-migration]
- Use Document Service API instead of deprecated Entity Service API
- Use `documentId` instead of numeric IDs
- Use `status` filters instead of `publishedAt` checks
- Implement proper draft/publish testing patterns
- Handle content type relationships correctly

**Payment Data Models**
- Test payment method security and encryption
- Test payment confirmation workflows
- Test payment review and approval processes
- Test manual payment handling
- Test payment comments and communication
- Test payment data integrity and relationships
