# Story X.8: Product Listing and Variants Integration Tests

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for Product Listing and Variants modules that verify product listing management and variant functionality,
**so that** we can ensure product listing and variant functionality works correctly in a real environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Product listing module integration tests cover all CRUD operations
2. Product listing variant management and operations are tested
3. Product listing relationships and associations are tested
4. Product listing variant relationships are tested
5. All tests verify database records are created/updated/deleted correctly
6. Tests follow established testing standards and patterns

- [x] Test product listing variant inheritance
- [x] Test product listing variant validation rules
- [x] Test product listing variant cleanup on deletion
- [x] Test product listing variant performance optimization

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Builds on Story X.1 (Integration Test Infrastructure) - uses the established test framework
- Extends existing Jest configuration and testing standards
- Leverages established testing patterns from `docs/architecture/test-standard.md`
- Integrates with existing Strapi 5 Document Service API patterns

### Testing Architecture
**Product Listing Integration Test Example** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
```typescript
// Product Listing Integration Test Example
describe('Product Listing Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should create product listing and verify database record', async () => {
    const product = await testFactories.createProduct();
    const productListingData = {
      product: product.documentId,
      title: 'Test Product Listing',
      description: 'Test listing description',
      status: 'active',
      featured: false
    };
    
    // Create product listing via API
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/product-listings')
      .send({ data: productListingData })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Verify database record
    const dbRecord = await testDb.verifyRecord('api::product-listing.product-listing', {
      documentId: response.body.data.documentId
    });
    
    expect(dbRecord.product.documentId).toBe(product.documentId);
    expect(dbRecord.title).toBe(productListingData.title);
    expect(dbRecord.status).toBe(productListingData.status);
  });
});
```

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#integration-tests]
- Use real PostgreSQL database connection
- Start Strapi dev server before test execution
- Verify database records after API operations
- Clean up test data after each test
- Follow established naming conventions and patterns
- Implement proper error handling and timeout management
- Use test data factories for consistent test data
- Implement test isolation through database transactions

**Product Listing-Specific Test Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations with database verification
- Test product listing relationships and associations
- Test product listing validation and constraints
- Test product listing performance optimization
- Test product listing bulk operations

**Product Listing Variant-Specific Test Requirements**
- Test all CRUD operations with database verification
- Test product listing variant relationships
- Test product listing variant validation and constraints
- Test product listing variant performance optimization
- Test product listing variant bulk operations

### Technical Constraints
**Strapi 5 Document Service API** [Source: architecture/test-standard.md#document-service-api-migration]
- Use Document Service API instead of deprecated Entity Service API
- Use `documentId` instead of numeric IDs
- Use `status` filters instead of `publishedAt` checks
- Implement proper draft/publish testing patterns
- Handle content type relationships correctly

**Product Listing and Variants Data Models**
- Test product listing relationships and associations
- Test product listing variant relationships
- Test product listing validation and constraints
- Test product listing variant validation and constraints
- Test data integrity and performance optimization
