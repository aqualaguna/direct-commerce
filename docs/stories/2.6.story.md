## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.5 (Product Media Management):
- Product media management system is being implemented
- Image upload, processing, and optimization capabilities are in development
- Media library management and gallery generation are in progress
- This story will build on the media management foundation for variant-specific images

### Product Variant Requirements
- **ProductListing Architecture**: Implemented ProductListing as customer-facing entity with type [single, variant]
- **Product Base Entity**: Product becomes the base entity with core product data, ProductListing handles customer-facing attributes
- **ProductListing Relationships**: ProductListing has one-to-many relationship with ProductListingVariant
- **Option System**: Comprehensive OptionGroup and OptionValue models for flexible variant options
- **Variant Support**: ProductListingVariant supports multiple option combinations (size + color, material + style, etc.)
- **Pricing & Inventory**: Variant-specific pricing, inventory tracking, and availability management
- **Image Management**: Leverages Strapi's native media functionality for variant images
- **Selection & Validation**: Comprehensive variant selection validation and availability checking
- **Order Integration**: OrderItem can reference ProductListingVariant for variant-specific orders

### Data Models to Create

#### ProductVariant Model
```typescript
interface ProductVariant {
  id: string;
  product: Product;
  sku: string;
  price: number; // in cents, overrides product price
  comparePrice?: number;
  inventory: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  optionValues: OptionValue[]; // combination of options (size: L, color: red)
  images: Media[]; // variant-specific images
  weight?: number; // variant-specific weight
  dimensions?: {
    length: number;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### OptionGroup Model
```typescript
interface OptionGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string; // e.g., "Size", "Color", "Material"
  displayName: string;
  type: 'select' | 'radio' | 'checkbox';
  isRequired: boolean;
  sortOrder: number;
  products: Product[]; // products that use this option group
  optionValues: OptionValue[];
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

#### OptionValue Model
```typescript
interface OptionValue {
  id: string;
  optionGroup: OptionGroup;
  value: string; // e.g., "L", "Red", "Cotton"
  displayName: string;
  sortOrder: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  variants: ProductVariant[]; // variants that use this option value
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test variant creation, option management, pricing, inventory, and validation
- Test variant combination logic and availability checking

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Variant combinations should be unique per product
- Option values should be reusable across products
- Variant pricing should override product base pricing
- Inventory should be tracked at variant level
- Variant images should inherit from product if not specified

### Project Structure Notes
- Variant functionality will extend existing product API
- Services should contain business logic for variant management and validation
- Controllers should handle variant CRUD operations and option management
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Option groups and values should be shared across products
- Variant-specific images should use existing media management system

### Business Rules
- Each variant must have a unique SKU within the product
- Variant price overrides product base price
- Variant inventory is tracked separately from product inventory
- Option combinations must be unique per product
- Option groups can be reused across multiple products
- Variant images inherit from product if not specified
- Variant availability depends on inventory and active status
- Option values must belong to an option group

### Performance Considerations
- Variant queries should be optimized for product listings
- Option group/value caching for frequently accessed data
- Efficient variant combination validation
- Lazy loading for variant images
- Indexing on variant SKU and option combinations
- Pagination for large variant lists


## Testing
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest 30+ with Supertest for API testing
- Testing frameworks and patterns: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test variant creation with various option combinations
  - Test option group and value management
  - Test variant-specific pricing and inventory
  - Test variant image management and inheritance
  - Test variant selection and availability validation
  - Test option combination uniqueness and validation
  - Test variant SKU uniqueness and validation
  - Test performance with large variant lists
  - Test integration with existing product and order systems
