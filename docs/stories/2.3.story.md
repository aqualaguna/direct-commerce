## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 completion:
- Category management system is fully implemented with hierarchical CRUD operations
- Category-product relationship management is functional with bulk operations
- Navigation and breadcrumb generation is working
- Category status management and sorting are implemented
- Comprehensive test coverage is in place (43 tests)
- All category management features are production-ready

### Inventory Management Requirements
- Product content type already has inventory field [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Core inventory fields: inventory (quantity), isActive (availability) [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-model]
- Need to extend with: reserved quantity, low stock threshold, inventory history
- Real-time updates required for accurate stock management
- Integration with order system for stock reservation

### API Specifications
- REST API endpoints will follow Strapi conventions: `/api/inventory` [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#product-endpoints]
- API responses will follow Strapi's standard REST format with pagination metadata [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#base-configuration]
- Authentication required for admin operations [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]
- JWT Bearer token authentication for protected endpoints [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication]

### File Locations
- Inventory controller: `apps/strapi/src/api/inventory/controllers/inventory.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Inventory service: `apps/strapi/src/api/inventory/services/inventory.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

- Inventory content type: `apps/strapi/src/api/inventory/content-types/inventory/schema.json` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Inventory policies: `apps/strapi/src/api/inventory/policies/` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]
- Test files: `apps/strapi/src/api/inventory/controllers/inventory.test.ts` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#strapi-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing: Jest + Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Test inventory tracking, alerts, history, reservations, and analytics

### Technical Constraints
- Strapi version: 4.25+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]
- Node.js version: 20+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- TypeScript version: 5.9.2+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-language]
- Inventory updates must be atomic and thread-safe
- Real-time updates should be efficient and scalable
- Audit trail should be comprehensive but not impact performance
- Stock reservations should have automatic expiration

### Project Structure Notes
- New inventory API will be created for dedicated inventory management
- Product content type will be extended with additional inventory fields
- Services should contain business logic for inventory calculations
- Policies should enforce proper authorization for inventory operations
- Test files should be co-located with source files
- Analytics and reporting should be separate services

### Business Rules
- Inventory cannot go below zero (prevent overselling)
- Reserved stock should be subtracted from available inventory
- Low stock alerts should be configurable per product
- Inventory history should track all changes with timestamps
- Stock reservations should expire after a configurable time
- Inventory updates should be atomic to prevent race conditions

### Inventory Management Features
- **Real-time Tracking**: Immediate updates to inventory levels
- **Stock Reservation**: Reserve stock for pending orders
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Configurable thresholds and notifications
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all inventory changes
- **Analytics**: Inventory performance metrics and reporting
- **Validation**: Prevent overselling and ensure data integrity

### Integration Points
- Product API: Update product inventory levels
- Order System: Reserve stock for pending orders
- Notification System: Send low stock alerts
- Analytics System: Provide inventory performance data
- Admin Panel: Display inventory management interface

## Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: Co-located with source files in `apps/strapi/src/`
- Test standards: Jest for backend, unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Testing frameworks: Jest 30+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- Specific testing requirements: Unit tests for inventory tracking, alert generation, history management, reservation system, analytics calculations
