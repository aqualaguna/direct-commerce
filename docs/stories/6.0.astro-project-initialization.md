  integrations: [
    'react', // React for interactive components
    'tailwind', // Tailwind CSS for styling
    'image', // Image optimization
    'sitemap' // SEO sitemap generation
  ];
  output: 'static' | 'server' | 'hybrid';
  build: {
    assets: '_astro';
    inlineStylesheets: 'auto';
  };
  vite: {
    ssr: {
      external: ['@strapi/strapi'];
    };
  };
}

// Project Structure
interface ProjectStructure {
  src: {
    pages: string[]; // Astro pages
