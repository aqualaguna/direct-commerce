## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | No rate limiting on API endpoints | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified*

## Medium Priority Risks

### 1. SEC-001: No rate limiting on API endpoints

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - API endpoints are publicly accessible without rate limiting
**Impact**: Medium - Could lead to abuse or DoS attacks
**Mitigation**:
- Implement rate limiting middleware for all API endpoints
- Add IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- Monitor API usage patterns
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with rate limiting, security testing for abuse scenarios

### 2. PERF-001: Potential N+1 queries in relationships

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Strapi relationships can cause N+1 queries if not properly populated
**Impact**: Medium - Could impact performance as data grows
**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper population strategies in API calls
- Add database query monitoring
- Consider implementing GraphQL for complex queries
**Testing Focus**: Performance testing with large datasets, query optimization testing

## Low Priority Risks

### 3. OPS-001: Limited monitoring for content type operations

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Basic monitoring is in place
**Impact**: Medium - Could miss operational issues
**Mitigation**:
- Add comprehensive logging for content type operations
- Implement health checks for database connections
- Set up alerts for failed operations
**Testing Focus**: Monitoring setup validation, alert testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks identified*

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Security testing for rate limiting implementation
- Performance testing with large datasets and relationship queries
- Load testing to identify bottlenecks

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Monitoring and alerting validation
- Operational readiness testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No critical risks requiring immediate fixes*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks can be addressed in next sprint
- Low risks can be monitored and addressed as needed

### Accepted Risks

- All identified risks are acceptable for current development phase
- Team will address medium risks in upcoming sprints

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- API endpoint usage and rate limiting effectiveness
- Database query performance and optimization opportunities
- Content type operation success rates and error patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API usage patterns change significantly
- Database performance issues are reported
- New content types are added
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

- **Immediate**: Monitor API usage patterns
- **Next Sprint**: Implement rate limiting middleware
- **Future**: Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
