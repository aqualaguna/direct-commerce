## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | ES module compatibility issues in automation scripts | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified*

## Medium Priority Risks

### 1. TECH-001: ES module compatibility issues in automation scripts

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Scripts use CommonJS require() but package.json has "type": "module"
**Impact**: Medium - Automation scripts fail to run, blocking development workflows
**Mitigation**:
- Convert all scripts to use ES module imports (import/export)
- Update require() calls to import statements
- Test all automation scripts after conversion
**Testing Focus**: Verify all automation scripts run successfully after ES module conversion

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks identified*

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Test automation scripts after ES module conversion
- Verify environment setup scripts work correctly
- Test development automation workflows

### Priority 3: Standard Functional Tests

- ESLint and Prettier configuration testing
- Jest testing framework validation
- Database migration system testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- ES module compatibility issues must be resolved

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

*No risks requiring mitigation*

### Accepted Risks

*No risks identified for acceptance*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Automation script execution success rates
- Development workflow efficiency
- Code quality tool performance
- Environment setup success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Node.js version is updated
- Package.json module type is changed
- New automation scripts are added
- Development tooling is modified

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

- **Immediate**: Convert automation scripts to ES modules
- **Next Sprint**: Test all automation workflows
- **Future**: Add comprehensive testing for automation scripts

## Technical Assessment

### Strengths

- ✅ Comprehensive ESLint and Prettier configuration
- ✅ Excellent Jest testing framework setup
- ✅ Robust database migration system
- ✅ Secure environment variable management
- ✅ Comprehensive development automation scripts
- ✅ Well-structured test utilities and helpers

### Technical Issues

- ❌ ES module compatibility issues in automation scripts
- ⚠️ Minor linting warnings (unused variables)
- ⚠️ Deprecated Prettier configuration options

## Performance Assessment

### Strengths

- ✅ Efficient Jest configuration with proper test patterns
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier optimized for performance
- ✅ Database migration system with proper indexing
- ✅ Development automation scripts for efficient workflows

## Reliability Assessment

### Strengths

- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (40 tests, 5 test suites)
- ✅ Well-structured configuration files
- ✅ Proper error handling in automation scripts
- ✅ Environment validation system

### Issues

- ❌ Automation scripts fail due to ES module compatibility

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates excellent development environment and tooling setup with comprehensive configuration. The main risk is ES module compatibility issues in automation scripts, which can be easily resolved by converting the scripts to use ES module imports. Once this issue is fixed, the implementation will be production-ready with excellent development tooling.
