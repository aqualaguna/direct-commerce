- Privacy violations
- Compliance issues

**Probability**: Low
- Secure export with authentication
- Proper data sanitization
- Audit logging

**Mitigation**:
- Authentication required for exports
- Data sanitization for export
- Audit logging for export requests
- Rate limiting on export endpoints

**Effort**: Already implemented

### R-005: Consent Tracking Failures
**Description**: Failures in consent tracking system leading to compliance issues.

**Impact**:
- GDPR compliance violations
- Legal and regulatory issues
- User trust damage

**Probability**: Low
- Comprehensive consent tracking
- Audit trails for all changes
- Proper validation

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive consent tracking system
- Audit logging for all consent changes
- Regular compliance monitoring
- Automated consent validation

**Effort**: Already implemented

## Risk Totals

| Risk Level | Count | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | 0 | No critical risks identified |
| High | 0 | No high risks identified |
| Medium | 0 | No medium risks identified |
| Low | 5 | All risks are low probability and well-mitigated |

## Recommendations
