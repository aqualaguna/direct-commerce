### Background Context
The ecommerce landscape is dominated by major marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, Etsy) that charge exorbitant fees of 15-20%, significantly cutting into seller profits. Small businesses and entrepreneurs are forced to choose between high marketplace fees or expensive custom ecommerce development, with limited control over customer relationships and data. This project addresses this market gap by building a single-seller ecommerce platform on Strapi's headless CMS architecture that eliminates marketplace fees while providing essential ecommerce functionality and minimal company profile pages (About and Contact). The solution prioritizes sales and product discovery while maintaining professional presentation and trust-building elements.
