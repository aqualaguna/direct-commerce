# Epic 2.1: Code Migration to New Standards

## Epic Goal
Migrate all existing code to comply with updated coding standards and test standards to ensure consistency, maintainability, and improved code quality across the entire codebase.

## Epic Description
This sub-epic focuses on updating all existing code to align with the new coding standards and test standards. This includes migrating existing controllers, services, tests, and other components to follow the updated patterns, naming conventions, and testing methodologies. The migration will ensure all code follows the latest best practices and maintains consistency across the platform.
